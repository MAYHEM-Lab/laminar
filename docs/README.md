# Laminar

## Installation
Currently, all laminar development and benchmarking has been done on CentOS 7.

For the complete CentOS 7 VM setup and execution instructions, use the [VM setup Centos7](vm-setup-centos7.md) guide.

For a quick trial of laminar, have a look at the [manual install](manual-install.md) file.

## Benchmarks
Laminar has multiple benchmarks in the `benchmarks` directory.

The setup and execution instructions for these can be found in the [benchmarks](benchmarks.md) file.

## Developer Guides
For Laminar application developers: [Laminar Dev Guide](laminar-dev-guide.md)

For Laminar contributors: [Laminar Internals](laminar-internals.md)

NOTE: It is a good idea to go through the dev guide before reading through the Laminar internals.
